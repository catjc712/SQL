# For this project, I downloaded a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

#I performed analytics on the data using SQL. The results are below. 


#1 Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) 
who are not in the US. 

SELECT customerId, firstname, lastname, country
FROM customers
WHERE country <> 'USA';



#2 Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT * FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country = "Brazil" ;



#3 Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. 
The resulting table should show the customer's full name, 
Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT inv.InvoiceId, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices AS inv
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers AS cust 
ON inv.customerId = cust.customerId 
WHERE billingCountry = 'Brazil';



#4 Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE title LIKE '%Sales%Agent%';



#5 Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the 
Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry 
FROM chinook.Invoices;



#6 Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each 
sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales 
Agent's full name.

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;



#7 Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales 
Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT emp.LastName AS sales_agent_last_name, emp.Firstname AS sales_agent_first_name, 
cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;


#8 How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE "%2009%";



#9 What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total) AS 'total sales'
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE "%2009%";



#10 Write a query that includes the purchased track name 
with each invoice line ID.

SELECT inv.invoiceID, tra.name
FROM invoice_items AS inv
JOIN tracks AS tra
ON inv.trackID = tra.trackID;


#11 Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT it.invoiceLineId, tr.name AS Track, ar.name AS Artist
FROM invoice_items AS it
LEFT JOIN tracks AS tr
ON it.trackId = tr.trackID
INNER JOIN albums AS al
ON tr.AlbumId = al.albumId
LEFT JOIN artists AS ar
ON al.artistId = ar.artistId;



#12 Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT tr.name AS track, al.title AS Album_name, m.name AS Media_Type, g.name AS Genre
FROM tracks AS tr
JOIN albums AS al
ON tr.albumId = al.albumId
JOIN media_types AS m
ON tr.mediatypeid = m.mediatypeid
JOIN genres AS g
ON tr.genreId = g.genreId



#13 Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM Employees emp
JOIN Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;



#14 Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM Employees emp
JOIN Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND Inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(Inv.Total), 2))  DESC LIMIT 1;
