# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data by answering the following questions. 


#1 Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity? 

SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;



#2 What is the longest song realeased? Who sings it and how popular is it?

SELECT track_name, artist_name, duration_ms, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1;



#3 What is the average duration for the top 10 most popular songs?

SELECT AVG(duration_ms)
FROM Bit_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10



#4 What is the average danceability of each artist? Who are the top ten artists with the highest danceability?

SELECT artist_name, AVG(danceability) AS Avg_Danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY Avg_Danceability DESC
LIMIT 10;



#5 Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. 
Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, 
their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.

WITH Popularity_Average_CTE AS (
SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity) AS avg_popularity 
FROM Spotifydata 
GROUP BY artist_name)
SELECT  artist_name,
        avg_popularity,
        'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE avg_popularity>=90;
